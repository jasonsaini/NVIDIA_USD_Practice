# ðŸŒŸ Universal Scene Description (USD) Self-Paced Course Progress

This repository documents my journey and progress through a self-paced course on the Universal Scene Description (USD) framework developed by Pixar. 
[The course](https://learn.next.courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-FX-02+V1/course/#block-v1:DLI+S-FX-02+V1+type@chapter+block@258ba24018854cbfb9f7ff5e04b7d6f8) focuses on leveraging USD to enhance collaboration in 3D workflows, encompassing both technical and creative aspects.

## ðŸ“– Course Description

The course is structured to introduce participants to the USD framework, enabling them to generate scenes using human-readable Universal Scene Description ASCII (.USDA) files. 
By the end of this course, I aim to create my own scenes within the USD framework and apply this knowledge in various applications like Omniverse, Maya, Unity, and Unreal Engine.

### ðŸ“š Sections

1. **USD Fundamentals**: 
    - Introduction to the basics of USD.
    - No programming knowledge required.

2. **Advanced USD**: 
    - Utilizing Python to generate USD files.
    - Covers more complex aspects of USD.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Throughout this course, I'm learning:

- The structure of USD scenes.
- Hands-on experience with USD Composition Arcs.
- Techniques like overriding asset properties with Sublayers.
- Combining assets using USD References.
- Creating asset variations with USD Variants.
