    "What makes USD unique?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've only talked about things that are easily accomplished in other kinds of graphics files. One of the most interesting features of USD is the idea of layer composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer composition refers to the ways USD files can be combined together. There are a number of ways you can combine USD files, and these are usually referred to as _composition arcs_.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 kinds of composition arcs in USD:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Sublayers**: similar to layers in Photoshop, sublayers in USD define a stack of USD layers. A stack is in strength order, and sublayers can override each other. If two sublayers have values for the same attribute, the strongest sublayer wins.\n",
    " 2. **References**: used to add new items into a scene. For instance, if you have a chair model, and you want 4 chairs around a table, you could add 4 references to the chair model.\n",
    " 3. **Payloads**: like a reference that can be loaded in a deferred way. You can open a scene and choose which item of the scene to load in memory.\n",
    " 4. **Variants**: used to switch between items in a collection. For example, if the chair model had a weather version, a wood version and an Eames version, a variant would let us choose between them.\n",
    " 5. **Inherits**: works in a similar fashion to a class in an object-oriented programming language. You define a class of items, like \"Humans\", which all have an `eyeColor` property. All human Prims could inherit from that class, and automatically have the shared `eyeColor` property.\n",
    " 6. **Specializes**: behaves in a similar way to _Inherits_, but with subtle differences that may be too specific for the scope of this brief overview."
